\usage{
merge_consecutive_trips(
  x,
  consecutive_time = NULL,
  consecutive_distance = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing raw pds trips data.}

\item{consecutive_time}{Time between consecutive trips (hrs).}

\item{consecutive_distance}{Distance between consecutive trips (Km).}
}
\value{
A dataframe with pds trips including a new column \code{associated_to}
indicating the consecutive trips to be merged.
}
\description{
PDS data are quite patchy, sometimes an actual single trip is recorded as 2
different trips. This function calculates the temporal and the geographical
distance between two consecutive trips for each boat, merging those consecutive
trips that start before 180 minutes from the following within a range of 2 km.
