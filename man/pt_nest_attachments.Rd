\usage{
pt_nest_attachments(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing raw landings data from the Timor operations.}
}
\value{
Landings data in which the information about multiple attachments has
been nested into a single column (\verb{_attachments}) this column contains a
tibble for every row. This, attachment tibble has as many rows as there are
attachments.
}
\description{
Nests attachment columns obtained when reading structured data from the kobo
landings survey
}
\details{
One of the disadvantages of using structured survey data is that the tables
can become very wide (many columns). This happens when question groups or
other fields can be recorded multiple times. For example in the landings
survey, for each species captured, about 17 questions are recorded. There is
no limit to the number of species that can be recorded in the trip. If, for
example a survey records seven species we will have over a hundred columns in
the data corresponding to species information.

To improve that situation an avoid using multiple tables we use \strong{nested data
frames} (see \link[tidyr:nest]{tidyr::nest}). In nested data frames columns can be lists and
can contain arbitrary information, like other data frames, lists, vectors, or
models.
