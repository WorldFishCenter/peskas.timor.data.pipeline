}
\details{
This function downloads the survey metadata (survey information) as well as
the survey responses. Afterwards it uploads this information to cloud
services. File names used contain a
versioning string that includes the date-time and, if available, the first 7
digits of the git commit sha. This is acomplished using \code{\link[=add_version]{add_version()}}

The parameters needed in \code{conf.yml} are:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{surveys:
  landings:
    api:
    survey_id:
    token:
    file_prefix:
storage:
  storage_name:
    key:
    options:
      project:
      bucket:
      service_account_key:
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Progress through the function is tracked using the package \emph{logger}.
