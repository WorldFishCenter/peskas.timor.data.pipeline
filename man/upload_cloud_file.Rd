Upload a local file to a cloud storage bucket
}
\details{
\subsection{Google Cloud Services}{

For Google Cloud Services ("gcs") options must be a list with two fields:
\code{bucket} with the bucketname (character) you are uploading to, and
\code{service_account_key} with the contents of the authentication json file you
have downloaded from your Google Project.

This function uses \link[googleCloudStorageR:gcs_auth]{googleCloudStorageR::gcs_auth} and
\link[googleCloudStorageR:gcs_upload]{googleCloudStorageR::gcs_upload} under the hood to upload the file.
