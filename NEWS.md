# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 3.3.0

### Breaking changes

- Now kobo surveys are retrieved according the new v2 API. The function `retrieve_survey_data()` has been replaced by `get_kobo_data` updated to retrieve data from the new API. The function `retrieve_survey_metadata()` has been deprecated.


# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 3.2.0

## Improvements
- Align variables to the [Aquatic Food Ontology (AQFO)](https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/AQFO)

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 3.1.0

## Improvements

- Estimations are now weighted based on the number of records in each monthly bin. This improve the accuracy of estimations and reduce outliers effect.

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 3.0.0

## New features

- Integrated the ingestion of the new survey form "Peskas 2". The new form was
deployed with the aim to be more manageable for enumerators. It also includes some
more questions regarding the fish handling and trading.


# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 2.0.0

## Breaking changes

- Validation step in now implemented using google sheets using the `googlesheets4`
package.


# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 1.4.0

## Improvements

- Improve national and municipal estimates combining packags `Amelia` and
`mice` for missing and outliers data imputation.

- Integrating price per kg into export data

## Bug fixes

- Improved revenue outliers identification based on empirical information


# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 1.3.0

## New features

- Integrated taxa selection and filtering in tracks file deemed to the leaflet map in the portal

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 1.2.0

## New features

- Added a new feature in the function `ingest_pds_map`. The function process and upload a data frame containing the number of trips, CPE (catch per unit effort) and RPE (revenue per unit effort) splitted by grids to produce leaflet maps in the web portal.

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 1.1.0

## Improvements

- Improve the estimation of some fish groups' catches by calculating the weight per individual case by case.

## Bug fixes

-Fix error in cleaning of legacy landings: the columns indicating the number of individuals and fish length for catches > 60cm were exchanged

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 1.0.0

## Improvements

Adding option to produce Timor map filtered by fishing trips

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.20.0

## Improvements

- Improve the validation step by flagging those observation characterized by having positive revenue 
(individuals) despite 0 or null individuals (revenue).

- Use a log model to identify abnormal weight-revenue relationships on Cook's distance estimation.

- Replace NA catch code with catch code "0" and ensure these observations having non positive 
individuals and revenue.

- Use total length for weight calculation of MOO in all the landings (weights calculated with FL seem quite unrealistic)

- Use 95Â° quantile instead of median to summarise weight parameters for catch types, it seems to return 
more realistic weight estimations by single individuals.

## Bug fixes

- Split landings preprocessing in two jobs to avoid to run out of memory (docker exit code 137)

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.19.0

## New features

- Added a new function `ingest_pds_matched_trips` to ingest matched pds tracks and survey landings in a zip folder on a monthly scale.

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.18.0

## New features

- Added nutritional values for each catch by the function `get_nutrients_table`. The function links to the repository https://github.com/mamacneil/NutrientFishbase and join the estimated nutrients values with the FishBase species data.

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.17.0

## New features

- Added the folder *report* containing the scripts useful to generate a pdf report of Peskas. Such report is downloadable from Peskas portal.

- Generate and retrieve the pds track map with `ingest_pds_map()` and `get_tracks_map()`.


# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.16.0

## Breaking changes

### Improvements

- Deactivated check of uniqueness of IMEI per boat in `pt_`

### Breaking changes

- Landings pre-processing now renames a few columns in the data: specifically *submission_id* (used to be *_id*) and *landing_date* (used to be *date*)

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.7.0

### New features

- Added `ingest_legacy_landings` to retrieve data from legacy data (SFF landings)

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.6.0

### New features

- Added `air_get_records()` and `air_records_to_tibble()` to retrieve and process records from Airtable
- Added `pt_validate_boats()`, `pt_validate_devices()`, and `pt_validate_vms_installs()` to perform basic data validation from the metadata tables

### Improvements

- `cloud_object_name()` can now also match files by exact name and not just by prefix

### Breaking changes

### Breaking changes

- Renamed `ingest_timor_landings()` to `ingest_landings()` for brevity and because all functions relate to Timor anyways. 

### Improvements

- Renamed the job names in the github workflow as the functions that the job calls. 
- Improved documentation of the package: particularly the readme and the function reference.

### Bug fixes

- We now skip RCurl from windows tests

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.3.0

### New features

- The preprocessing of East Timor landings is implemented in `preprocess_landings()`
- Added `pt_nest_attachments()` to group all attachment columns into a nested column containing data frames.
- Added `pt_nest_species()` to group all attachment columns into a nested column containing data frames.
- Added `cloud_object_name()` as a complement to `add_version()` to return the latest or an specified version of an object in an storage location.
- Added `download_cloud_file()` to download files from cloud storage providers.

### Improvements

- Now using `cloud_storage_authenticate()` to internally authenticate to cloud storage instead of authenticating separately in each cloud functionjj. This simplifies authentication and ensures authentication is not attempted when credentials have been already validated. 

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

- `download_survey_data()`, `download_survey_metadata()`, and `download_survey()` have been renamed to `retrieve_survey_data()`, `retrieve_survey_metadata()`, and `retrieve_survey()`. This is to avoid confusion with planned functions that download data from cloud locations.
- The suffix *raw* and *metadata* that is appended to the prefix when retrieving survey information is now separated using "_" rather than "-". This is to more easily distinguish between information encoded in the file name.

### New features

- The prefix name of surveys is not hard-coded and can be specified in the config file (`file_prefix` field).

# peskas.timor.data.pipeline 0.1.0

Adds infrastructure to download survey data and upload it to cloud storage providers and implements the ingestion of East Timor landings. 

### New features

- The ingestion of East Timor Landings is implemented in `ingest_timor_landings()`. 
- The functions `download_survey_data()` and `download_survey_metadata()` which download data and metadata for an electronic survey hosted by *kobo*, *kobohr*, or *ona*. 
- `download_survey()` can be used as a wrapper to download data and metadata in a single call. 
- `upload_cloud_file()` can be used to upload a set of files to a cloud storage bucket. Currently only Google Cloud Services (GCS) is supported. 
- `add_version()` is an utility function that appends date-time and sha information to a string and is used to version file names. 
- `get_host_url()` is an utility function that gets the host url of an electronic survey provider API. 

### Pipeline

The data pipeline is implemented and run in GitHub Actions on a schedule.
